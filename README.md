Habit Tracker 

Build with React,Zustand, MetrialUI

#Zustand

- A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution.

1- Zustand is available as a package on NPM for use:
  - npm install zustand

2- create store
  - Your store is a hook! You can put anything in it: primitives, objects, functions. The set function merges state.

3- Then bind your components, and that's it!
  - You can use the hook anywhere, without the need of providers. Select your state and the consuming component will re-render when that state changes.
